# Tetris-Shooter

This project was made in 48 hours for the Mix and Game Jam 2020.

The code is based on the [tetris code](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_Tetris.cpp) by [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

If you want to test the game, you can do it in its itch.io [submission page](https://mults.itch.io/tetris-shooter).
